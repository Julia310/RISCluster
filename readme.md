# Deep Embedded Clustering
This project aims to implement deep embedded clustering (DEC) in the unsupervised classification of seismic signals detected on a 34-station passive broadband seismic array on the Ross Ice Shelf from November 2014 to November 2016.  The workflow contains the following elements:
1. Import modules and set up environment
2. Load and pre-process data
3. Construct the convolutional auto-encoder (CAE)
4. Tune, train, and validate CAE
5. Determine optimal number of clusters using gap statistic analysis
6. Incorporate Clustering Layer into Model Architecture
7. Train the DEC Model
8. Evaluate Performance of DEC Model

This work has been heavily adapted from Dylan Snover's master's thesis workflow.
